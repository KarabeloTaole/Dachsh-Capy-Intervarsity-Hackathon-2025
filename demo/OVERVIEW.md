## 💡 Inspiration

The inspiration for DC Savings came from recognizing that traditional savings apps often feel isolating and lack the motivation needed for long-term financial success. Many people struggle with saving money because it can feel like a solitary, boring task with distant rewards.

We wanted to solve this by:
- **Making saving social** - People are more likely to stick to goals when they have community support
- **Adding game elements** - Challenges, leaderboards, and achievements make saving fun and engaging
- **Celebrating small wins** - Regular positive reinforcement helps build sustainable habits
- **Creating accountability** - Social visibility encourages consistent saving behavior

The goal is to transform saving money from a chore into an enjoyable, community-driven activity that people actually look forward to participating in.
